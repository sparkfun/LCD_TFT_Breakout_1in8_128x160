1) Are the part libraries consistent with eagle github repo? [NO]
comment: No. I haven't added the display to the libraries because I'm not sure where to put it, besides the part on the board is an FPC connector, not the display itself. I did add the FPC connector under the 40 position connector in the connectors library. Also there is one footprint that is just a custom solder position for the user so I'm not sure if that goes in the library

2) Have you verified that the BOM in Sparkle is accurate (also checking for PROD_ID, NAME, VALUE, PREFIX)? [NO]
comment: No Sparkle product yet... 

3) Do V-Scored edges have a 50 mil border free of pads and parts (to prevent cracking on separation)? [NO]
comment: Nearly... but I want the FPC connector to be right up at the edge of one vscore so that one violates this rule

4) Are all QFN components with 6 or more leads 75 percent pasted on lead pads? (May be contended depending on performance) [NO]
comment: They're closer to 80-90% pasted

5) Is there a correct version number in the copper (aligned properly with the edge of the PCB)? [NO]
comment: I couldn't fit it right on the edge, but it's close ish

6) Are all PTHs (aka connectors) clearly labeled with their purpose on both sides of the board? [NO]
comment: No, bottom side is unlabeled due to space constraints
